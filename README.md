# Git + GitHub Workshop Part 2 - Collaborating and conflicts
## Wiep Stikvoort and Eider P-Ordoyo Bellido

During this workshop and after an initial refresher from the first part, you will learn:
* Forking repositories
* Creating pull requests (PRs) with reviewers
* Merging: types of merge
* Conflicts: when starting the merge or during the merge
* Ways to solve conflict

This README file also contains some resources we thought could be useful, both to learn and for future reference.
